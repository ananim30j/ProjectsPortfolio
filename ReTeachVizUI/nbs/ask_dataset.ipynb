    "In the era of big data, extracting insights from datasets can often be a complex and code-intensive process. This Jupyter notebook presents an innovative approach to data analysis, harnessing the power of generative AI to interactively query and gain insights from CSV datasets. By utilizing OpenAI's chat completion API, this notebook demonstrates how one can ask questions directly to the data, bypassing traditional data analysis complexities.\n"
